## Project description

This is a website that was made by following the ruby on rails tutorial for the class.  This website allows the user to make an account, look at all the users of the app, and if an admin, It allows you to delete specific users.  The command line section at the bottom also tells the user what is happeneing on specific clicks. 

## How to compile and run the program

Lucky this is already in a heroku app, here is the link.

## UI Design

Almost every program requires user interaction, even command-line programs. Include in this section the tasks the user can complete and what the program does. You don't need to include how it works here; that information may go in the project description or in an additional section, depending on its significance.
