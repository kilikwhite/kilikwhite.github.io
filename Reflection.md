# Reflection Questions From: **Kilik White** 

## Discuss one challenge you overcame during your academic development. What was the challenge, was it technical, nontechnical, or both, and how did you overcome it?
The challenge that I have overcome during my academic development was Data Structures at Charleston Southern University.  That class was a challenge since I failed 
the class the first time due to my lack of knowledge of C++.  I managed to overcome the challenges of the class by learning from my previous mistakes when I retook it. 
It made my programming in the class better since I have written less code and I have had less errors when going through the class.

## Discuss a situation where you worked with a team. How would you describe yourself as a teammate? Where can you improve your team skills? Be specific
During my major, there were a lot of times when I worked in a team with some partners I got to choose while others the partnership was random.  One main situation that 
sticks out was when I was on a team in Software Design and Development.  We were tasked with building a website for a client highlighted in the project using what we knew 
in the course and all the courses before it.  Within the team, I was proactive with the assignments and I made it to every team meeting with the team despite a rough start.  
I also managed to learn a small amount when it came to the new software that developers want to use.  I can improve my team skills by communicating more frequently then
 I already have and reaching out immediately when I have an issue. 

## What type of career in CS do you believe you are most suited for? Why this field and not another? Be specific.
The type of career in CS that I personally believe that I am most suited for is Software Engineering.  I am suited for Software Engineering because I personally enjoy 
creating software despite the annoyances that it produces.  I also know a decent amount of languages to keep up with being a Software Engineer since I know how to 
program in C++, Java, HTML, CSS, PHP, and a small amount  of Python.  I can also decently figure out what happened to cause the code to get an error which I can then 
use to update the software and fix it.

## What  professional organizations would you like to join? What professional development would you like to be a part of in the next five years? Be specific and don't consider places of employment.
I would like to join either the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET), or IEEE Computer Society.  
The professional development that I would like to be part of in the next five years would be to improve my performance in the field.  This means that I will keep 
practicing the skills that I do have and refine them even more.  Along with refining, I will make sure I find out new developments in my fields and keep track of 
the technologies that will help me stay up to date with new developing technology.

## What are the ways you can use the skills you have learned in CS to serve your community? Be specific
One of the ways I can use the skills I learned in Computer Science to serve the community is through Computer Hardening.  I can use the basic knowledge from Cyber 
Defense to help someone have a more secure computer. That knowledge can help make sure that the person is not in a position to be hacked.  Another way I can use my 
skills for the community is to both help new programmers learn how to code and help explain some of the errors that the program is giving.  Finally, I can decently 
educate people on how the Internet works.  Thanks to my applied networking class, I learned how the Internet worked including why the internet speeds suddenly decreased.
